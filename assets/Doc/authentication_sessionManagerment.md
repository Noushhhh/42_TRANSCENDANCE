# 🚀 Enhanced Authentication and Session Management Documentation

## 1. Enhanced Session Management 🕒

Aligned user session expiration with JWT token expiration for improved security and consistency.

### Backend Implementation
- `sessionExpiresAt` is set in the user record on JWT token generation.
- The expiration time is aligned with the JWT token's duration.

## 2. Activity-Based Auto Logout (`useActivityLogout` Hook) 🛌

Automatically logs out users after a period of inactivity.

### Frontend Implementation
- Sets a logout timer (`setTimeout`) based on user inactivity.
- User interactions reset the timer.
- Triggers logout and redirection after the timeout.

## 3. Token Refresh Mechanism (`useRefreshToken` Hook) 🔁

Manages the renewal of access tokens using refresh tokens.

### Frontend Implementation
- Communicates with the `refreshToken` backend endpoint.
- Updates the access token upon successful response.
- Returns a success/failure status.

## 4. Improved Authentication Logic in `signin` Function 🔐

Enhances session integrity by preventing multiple logins in the same session.

### Backend Implementation
- Checks for existing active sessions before allowing new logins.
- Prevents login if an active session is detected.

## 5. Backend Token Refresh Endpoint (`refreshToken`) 🔄

Handles requests for JWT token refreshes.

### Backend Implementation
- Validates refresh token requests.
- Issues a new access token upon validation.
- Updates session information in the database.
